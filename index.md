### Augmented Reality Development

As a software developer at Robotic Eyes, Graz, I developed several applications for Android and iOs based on Unity Engine and rexos cloud.

### Context-Cues Segmentation

As a software developer at the CVLab of École Polytechnique de Lausanne. I worked in a fantastic brain segmentation project with @cbecker. We implemented a plugin for the mitochondria segmentation software ESPina.

### Helimap Navigation System 2 and Quickdrop

As a software developer at Helimap Systems, I developed a helicopter navigation system which we used in our 3d mapping missions, as well as a quick drop ortorectification software and other smaller stuff.

Unfortunately, both codes are under Non Disclosure Agreement.

### IRI ROS WAM stack

During my stay at Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial of BarcelonaTech I developed a ROS stack and low-level driver for the control of Barrett's Whole Arm Manipulator robot. The code is part of the IRI's ROS repository.

Check out [WAM's repository](https://github.com/polmonso/ros_iri_wam)

Later, I also developed a planning and manipulation for the WAM based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, which made it as an [article](http://www.iri.upc.edu/files/scidoc/1365-POMDP-approach-to-robotized-clothes-separation.pdf) to the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2012).

### Trilogue

As part of the [Trilogue Collective](trilogueart.wordpress.com) ([Ursula Graber](ursulagraber.wordpress.com), Pol Monsó Purtí, [Diego Jiménez Tamame](diegojimeneztamame.com)). The Trilogue Collective, focuses its work on the multiple possibilities offered by the development of synergies and feedback processes between different artistic disciplines, aspiring to redefine the boundaries between them within the framework of creation contemporary art.

The collaboration between the three artists for the first version of the Trilogue project (2017), together with the interest they share in the use of multi-media resources in their respective fields, gave birth to the Trilogue Collective, with the vocation to continue multidisciplinary artistic research through the use of technological tools.

## as a Games Developer

### Battlechess

Check out [Battlechess](polmonso.github.com/battlechess) for info!

A mix between Battleship and chess. The main plot turn being that you can only see around your pieces.

Developed together with [Antoine Letouzey](https://antoine.sxbn.org/) in our free time. Pending to set a lobby or similar to release it seriously.

### EAWars and EABattles

A long time ago, around 2008, together with @daiku60 and @kaikcreator we coded a java role-playing strategy game with an age of empires-like skirmish mini-game based on JOGL inside. It was a very interesting project which led to an intense political game with several friends.

## as a Musician

I've played as a keyboardist with [eterians](https://eterians.bandcamp.com/), [CBMD](https://cbmd.bandcamp.com/) and many others.

I usually lean to funk, jazz and blues. Or more like gloomy music when I play on my own.

Check out [eterians 28 disk](https://eterians.bandcamp.com/) for a taste.
